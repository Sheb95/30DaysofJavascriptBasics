## Introduction

I have set myself a goal to allocate at least one hour a day to revisiting JavaScript fundamentals. I realise that my understanding of how JavaScript works is something that still needs to be worked on. Thus, my objective in doing this challenge is:

-  Review üìì and strengthen üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the JavaScript fundamentals that I already have learned.
-  Go into more depth about how JavaScript works. I am the type of learner where knowing the "why" in something or little quirks about it helps me retain information about the topic. There is a chance that I will go down rabbit holes sometimes, but I shall allocate that as an "extra time" activity.
-  PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE! I will then implement what I learned in conceptual projects. They won't be pretty but they will serve as little experiments üß™ for me to investigate further concepts and also break the code. I will also use codewars as a further exercise to reinforce concepts.

## Resources

I will use the following resources to aid me on this journey:

-  JavaScript - The Complete Guide 2022 (Beginner + Advanced) (Udemy) (Main)
-  The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert! (Udemy) (Supplementary)
-  FreeCodeCamp (for exercises)
-  CodeWars (practice)
-  The MDN Docs

### _But, why are you using two courses?_

I have them already so why not use them? In all seriousness though, it helps me for more difficult concepts to see/hear different explanations. Additionally, both courses, while offering an in-depth look at JavaScript approach it in different ways. The supplementary course has exercises I can do whereas the main course is more theoretical. I am willing to change if necessary if it becomes too complicated.

## Structure

Most topics won't be covered in a day. Therefore the topics covered will be split up into branches. It will make it alot easier for me to manage my work as well as look back at it.
